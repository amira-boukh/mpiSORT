# mpiSORT

This software allows the sorting of high-throughput sequencing data after alignment from [SAM files](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/). `mpiSORT` relies on the Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard to perform the parallelisation of the sorting processing over multiple cores and nodes of high performance computing clusters.
